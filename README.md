# AI-Lab-1
The goal of this work is to understand how to model problems, to solve and implement the search algorithms.

Here is his statement of the problem: https://www.emse.fr/~picard/cours/ai/search/index.html

The source files were written by Pr. Gauthier PICARD (inspired from the algorithm provided by AIMA-Java Project), then completed by us following the exercices presented in the previous link. The three following problems were modelised and solved by me and my colleague Anas Rachid and Adil EL hakouni.

The files are to be found in the src folder of the Java Project.

Core contains the mother classes (Problem, Node and Search) and the Solvers (AbstractTreeSearch and the one we use next AbstractGraphSearch).

Solver contains the search algorithms ready to use : Depthfirst and Breadthfirst for a graph and a tree search problem (graph in our case).

Simple contains a simple graph and tree example explained in the link above.

exo5 corresponds to the first problem : The farmer's problem.

exo6 corresponds to the second problem : The cannibal's problem.

exo7 corresponds to the third problem : The two cans' problem.
